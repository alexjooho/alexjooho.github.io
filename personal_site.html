    <p>
        I am from Orange County, California and I graduated from UCSD in 2021 with a degree in human biology. Prior to making the career switch,
        I was pre-dental, and was actually supposed to matriculate to Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC this coming August. However, after much
        contemplation and soul searching, I decided that dentistry was not for me and that software engineering was a much better fit for me. I got introduced
        to this field by my friends who are studying computer science in college, and I found that I was having so much fun whenever I spent time self-learning JavaScript.
        As someone whose favorite subjects have always been math and physics, I have an innate love for problem solving and learning and I would love to 
        continue to problem solve and learn in this wonderful career.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time I love to spend time with my friends, girlfriend, and family. Whether it be going out for food or playing board games at home, 
        I'm always happiest when spending time with the ones I care about. I also love to play with my dog Toby and give him treats even when I know I shouldn't.

        Making the switch from a relatively "safe" career as a future dentist is definitely one of the scariest decisions I have made in my life. 
        I had already paid my deposit to USC Dental School and was ecstatic to get in, but after hearing about some friends who decided to make a career change
        into software engineering, I decided I should at least consider my options before making the 4+ year committment to becoming a dentist.
        Although my resume mostly consists of dentistry-related extracurriculars, I believe my experiences and GPA show that I have the work ethics necessary to succeeding in this field.
        I am still very new to the field, but I will soon be starting a 16-week software engineering bootcamp at Rithm School, where I will be learning 
        JavaScript, Python, CSS, Node, etc. in order to learn everything I need to know for both front-end and back-end work. By the time I finish the bootcamp
        I hope to have a few projects in my resume and be prepared to enter the job market with confidence.
